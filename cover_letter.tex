    \lettersection{About}

    My name is Vasileios Kefalas, I am currently 25 years old and I am taking lessons in Informatics and Telecommunications at the University of Peloponnese.
    In the past, I have been employed in a telecommunications company, Vodafone, in which I provided technical and network problem resolution to end users, including analyzing problems and forming solutions. My employment at the above company spanned nearly a year, as  1-level fixed residential technical support. Prior to that, I had also joined the Sales Department Team at Plaisio computers company.
    %------------------------------------------------

    \lettersection{Why Me?}

    Ever since my first university projects, it has been my goal to progress in web development and seek employment. Taking steps in that direction, I came across Netstudio on Instagram. Doing some further research online,
    I became very interested in your business model and product offering - your approach to websites with identity, optimisation and effectiveness is a concept I would very much enjoy being employed on. I strongly believe that my skillset
    would make me a fine addition to your team, in particular as it pertains to the Junior Web Developer position. More specifically, my experience with Vodafone has given me direct exposure to problem-solving skills,
    attention to detail, experience in a cooperative environment, ability to prioritise the workload, as well as my personal engagement with coding has allowed me to gain knowledge of how to create a user friendly, secure website.

    \lettersection{Closure}

    Please find attached my CV; you can also refer to my LinkedIn page or Github page for further detail via the hyperlink.
    I would be delighted to have the opportunity of an initial interview and can be reached anytime.
    Thank you for your consideration and look very much forward to hearing back!
